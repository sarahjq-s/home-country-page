# home-country-page

👋Hi everyone! After completing my first Solo Project: Hometown Homepage at Scrimba, I decided to build my Home Country Homepage: Visit Philippines.

Requirements from [Solo Project: Hometown Homepage](https://github.com/sarahjq-s/solo-project-hometown-page#solo-project-hometown-page)
<ul>
  <li>✅ use classes</li>
  <li>✅ use flexbox</li>
  <li>✅ add a background-image</li>
  <li>✅ use the provided color palette</li>
</ul>

🙌 Stretch Goals:
<ul>
  <li>✅ make your own hometown or country homepage</li>
  <li>✅ use a different color palette</li>
  <li>✅ use Google font</li>
  <li>✅ use :hover</li>
  <li>✅ add whole new section</li>
</ul>

While working on this project, I ran into some challenges with flexbox again but this time it was easier to understand what I was doing wrong. The challenge I faced and how I overcame it:

✈️ Destination section - I ran into the problem of having the images appear ellipse instead of circle. With the Hometown Project, I only needed the width but with this page I needed to put both height and width properties to get the images appear circular. Do you have other solution?

 😃 I really enjoyed working on this project because I get to share about my home country. Looking forward to learning more and being able to make a responsive website!

I'd appreciate anyone who would be kind to review my code for me to learn from it and improve on my skills 🙏

Thank you and Happy coding! SARAH 🍵
