# home-country-page

👋Hi everyone! After completing my first Solo Project: Hometown Homepage at Scrimba, I decided to build my Home Country Homepage: Visit Philippines. 

Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>✅ use classes</li>
  <li>✅ use flexbox</li>
  <li>✅ add a background-image</li>
  <li>✅ use the provided color palette</li>
</ul>

🙌 Stretch Goals:
<ul>
  <li>✅ make your own hometown or country homepage</li>
  <li>✅ use a different color palette</li>
  <li>✅ use Google font</li>
  <li>✅ use :hover</li>
  <li>✅ add whole new section</li>
</ul>


While working on this project, I ran into some challenges with flexbox. 😵 I'm still struggling with the concept especially aligning elements horizontally vs vertically but I'm slowly understanding it more. The challenges I faced and how I overcame them:

🎭 Activities section - I was challenged to make a three column section for the top 3 activities. I figured how to do it by setting up a div for each activity and then placing them inside a div, flex container, to display and align them accordingly.

🧑 Guide section - It was hard to format the text elements inside the card 😓. I learned more about using the flex-direction: column to align the elements vertically. Once I figured that out, I used the justify-content to space them out. I tried between the space-between and space-evenly and made final adjustments using the margin property.

I'd appreciate anyone who would be kind to review my code for me to learn from it and improve on my skills 🙏

Thank you and Happy coding! SARAH 🍵
